# music_recommender_DecisionTree
This repo is created to recommend various music albums based on some attributes. In this project, I have applied machine learning to find the relation of selecting different types of music albums based on some given attributes of an individual. 

Imagine, we have online music store. When our users sign up, we asked the age and gender, and based on their profile, the model recommend various music albums their likely to buy. In this project we use DecisionTree approach to solve this problem. This project is a perfect example of using machine learning to increase the music album sales.
